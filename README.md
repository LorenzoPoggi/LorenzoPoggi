### Hi! My name is Lorenzo and I'm currently a High-School student.

I'm very interesting in learning programming for Finance Jobs, WebSite Development or School Projects.
My passion lies in systems engineering and problem-solving. I would like to expand my skills, by learning while I work into a company, to become a Full-Stack Developer.
